## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: '/people',
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string
      }[]
    }>
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData()
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
  },
})
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>,
  )
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools'

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

import './App.css'

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['people'],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from '@tanstack/react-store'
import { Store } from '@tanstack/store'
import './App.css'

const countStore = new Store(0)

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from '@tanstack/react-store'
import { Store, Derived } from '@tanstack/store'
import './App.css'

const countStore = new Store(0)

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
})
doubledStore.mount()

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore)
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).

# Window Management System

This portfolio features a macOS-style window management system with the following features:

## Features

- **Draggable Windows**: Click and drag the title bar to move windows around the screen
  - Smooth GSAP-powered dragging with elastic bounce on release
  - Subtle rotation and scale effect while dragging for realistic feedback
- **Resizable Windows**: Drag from any edge or corner to resize windows
  - 8 resize handles (4 edges + 4 corners)
  - Minimum size constraints enforced
- **Minimize/Maximize**: Use the macOS-style colored buttons (red, yellow, green) to close, minimize, or maximize windows
  - **macOS Genie Effect**: Windows minimize with a wavy squeeze animation
  - Smooth scale and fade animations on open
  - Elastic bounce effect when opening windows
- **Focus Management**: Click on a window to bring it to the front
- **Spotlight Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Space` to open the spotlight search (always appears on top)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+Space` - Open Spotlight
  - `Ctrl+T` - Toggle Terminal
  - `Ctrl+,` - Open Settings
  - `Escape` - Close Spotlight

## Window System Architecture

The window system uses **TanStack Store** for global state management:

```typescript
// Open a window
openWindow('terminal')

// Close a window
closeWindow('terminal')

// Toggle a window
toggleWindow('terminal')

// Minimize/Maximize
minimizeWindow('terminal')
maximizeWindow('terminal')
restoreWindow('terminal')

// Move/Resize
setWindowPosition('terminal', x, y)
setWindowSize('terminal', width, height)
```

## Creating Custom Windows

To create a new window component:

```tsx
import { WindowWrapper } from '@/components/window-wrapper'

export function MyWindow() {
  return (
    <WindowWrapper
      windowType="terminal" // Must match WindowType in store
      title="My Window"
      defaultWidth={800}
      defaultHeight={600}
      minWidth={400}
      minHeight={300}
    >
      {/* Your window content */}
    </WindowWrapper>
  )
}
```

The `WindowWrapper` component automatically handles:

- **Dragging** (via title bar) with GSAP smooth animations
- **Resizing** (via edges and corners)
- **Focus management** (click to bring to front)
- **Minimize/maximize states** with macOS-style animations
- **Z-index stacking**
- **Opening/closing animations**

## Animation System (GSAP)

The window system uses **GSAP** for smooth, professional animations:

### Window Lifecycle Animations

- **Open**: Scale up from 0.8 with elastic bounce (`back.out`)
- **Minimize**: macOS genie effect - wavy squeeze animation with timeline
- **Close**: Fade out with scale down

### Interaction Animations

- **While Dragging**: Slight rotation (0.5deg) and scale (1.02x) for depth
- **On Release**: Elastic bounce back to normal state
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth color transitions on control buttons

### Custom Hooks

Two custom hooks provide clean separation of concerns:

#### `useWindowDragResize`

Manages drag and resize logic:

```tsx
const { isDragging, handleMouseDown, handleResizeMouseDown } =
  useWindowDragResize({
    windowType,
    isMaximized,
    position,
    size,
    defaultWidth,
    defaultHeight,
    minWidth,
    minHeight,
    onFocus: window.focus,
  })
```

#### `useWindowAnimations`

Manages all GSAP animations:

```tsx
const { windowRef, contentRef } = useWindowAnimations({
  isOpen: window.isOpen,
  isMinimized: window.isMinimized,
  isMaximized,
  isDragging,
})
```

These hooks can be used independently in custom window implementations.
